## 🍁About

Serving as an upstream source for many excellent ad blocking lists, AWAvenue Ads Rule is one of the best open-source ad filter lists in the community. It delivers optimal ad blocking, privacy protection, and bandwidth savings. Compatible with various common network-layer ad blocking tools and proxy tools¹, AWAvenue Ads Rule stands out from lists with thousands of entries by maintaining a minimal size, high hit rate, and extremely low hardware requirements.

After subscribing to this rule, you’ll clearly notice annoying shake ads have disappeared, subscription lists and in-article ad streams fail to load, autoplay video ads vanish, boot ads on TV boxes and smart TVs are gone, and your phone gains extra free space (since ad files are blocked from being downloaded).

Compared to other ad-blocking methods, this network-layer filtering approach is low-cost, convenient, and broadly effective (such as deployment on routers). You don't need to configure each app individually; ads are filtered seamlessly without affecting your normal use of the original apps.

*As of July 2025, we can block over 90% of ad SDK content on Teyvat.*

### *If you have feedback or suggestions about the content of this rule, please be sure to check our [FAQ](https://awavenue.top/Knowledge.html#%E5%B8%B8%E8%A7%81%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98-%E4%B8%8E%E7%AD%94%E7%96%91) before submitting an issue or joining the group chat. These resources may help resolve your questions.*
