## 🍁 About

As one of the best upstream and open-source ad filter lists in the community, AWAvenue Ads Rule achieves top-notch ad blocking, privacy protection, and traffic saving. It supports all common network-level ad-blocking and proxy tools¹. Compared to other ad rule lists with thousands of entries, AWAvenue Ads Rule is extremely compact, highly effective, and requires minimal hardware resources.

After subscribing to this rule list, you'll notice that annoying shake ads disappear, ads in subscription lists and at the end of articles won't load, autoplay ad videos vanish, TV box/smart TV boot ads are gone, and your device storage may even increase (since ad files are blocked from downloading).

Compared to other ad removal methods, this network-level filtering is cost-effective, easy to use, and widely beneficial (e.g., router deployment). You don't need to configure each app individually; ads are filtered seamlessly without affecting your normal app usage.

*As of June 2025, we can block over 90% of ad SDK content in Teyvat.*

### *If you have comments or suggestions about AWAvenue Ads Rule, please check our [FAQ](https://awavenue.top/Knowledge.html#%E5%B8%B8%E8%A7%81%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98-%E4%B8%8E%E7%AD%94%E7%96%91) before submitting an issue or providing feedback in the group. The FAQ may answer your questions.*

## 🍁 How It Works
